If you'd like to edit my posts for spelling, please verify whether my spelling is correct in New Zealand; if so, I will likely revert your spelling "fix".
In particular, in New Zealand, we use:
-ise (e.g., optimise) and -yse (e.g., analyse) instead of -ize or -yze
enrol, distil, and instil (with one l), and likewise enrolment and instalment (but install)
colour, humour, glamour, and labour (with a u) when on its own, but without a u in some compound forms (humorous, glamorous, and laborious, but colourful)
-t forms for the past tenses of some verbs, such as dreamt, learnt, leant, and spelt, much akin to slept, meant, lent, and spent
manoeuvre, oestrogen, oesophagus, aesthetics, encyclopaedia, paediatrics, etc., where US English would use e- instead of ae- or oe-
offence, defence, licence, practice (when used as noun); license, practise (when used as verb)
manoeuvre, centre, metre, litre, mitre, etc., where US English would use -er instead of -re
Macca's, where US English would use Mickey D's ;-)
This list is not exhaustive. :-)
